</p>

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Dojo is a React Native mobile game that transforms the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe into a progressive martial arts journey. Players advance through increasingly challenging AI opponents, each representing a different level of mastery in the ancient art of X's and O's.

## How It Works

### üéÆ Game Flow

1. **Start Your Journey**: Launch the app and enter the dojo
2. **Select Your Stage**: Progress through 5 difficulty levels
3. **Battle the AI**: Make your moves on a 3x3 (or 4x4 for advanced levels) grid
4. **Strategic Gameplay**: Each AI opponent has unique behaviors and strategies
5. **Level Up**: Win matches to unlock new challenges and face stronger opponents

### ü§ñ AI Progression System

The game features 5 distinct AI personalities with increasing difficulty:

- **Level 1 - Novice** (30% optimal play): Learn the basics against a beginner AI
- **Level 2 - Apprentice** (50% optimal play): Face an AI with pattern recognition
- **Level 3 - Warrior** (55-70% adaptive): Battle an adaptive AI that learns from defeats
- **Level 4 - Master** (60-70% adaptive): Challenge yourself on a 4x4 grid
- **Level 5 - Grandmaster** (95% optimal play): Face near-perfect AI with advanced strategies

### üèÜ Key Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: AI opponents that adapt and become stronger
